    "In this unit we discuss matrices with special properties – symmetric, possibly complex, and positive definite. The central topic of this unit is converting matrices to nice form (diagonal or nearly-diagonal) through multiplication by other matrices. Generally, this process requires some knowledge of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix.\n",

Symmetric and positive definite matrices have extremely nice properties, and studying these matrices brings together everything we've learned about pivots, determinants and eigenvalues. In this session we also practice doing linear algebra with complex numbers and learn how the pivots give information about the eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix.\n",
